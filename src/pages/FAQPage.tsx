          <li>
            You pick a square and send a transaction to the ethereum network with your choice and the amount of ether
            you'd like to offer.
          </li>
          <li>
            The contract tracks your wager as well as everyone else's wager.
          </li>
          <li>
            I report the score 1 day after the big game.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once I report the score, the community participating in the grid has 7 days to affirm it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Votes are weighted by total stake in the grid. If you offer 0.3 ETH on one square and 0.1 ETH on another
            square, your total influence on the vote is 0.4 ETH.
          </li>
          <li>
            7 days after I report the score, if 2/3rds of the voters agree that I was honest, anyone can accept the
            final score to release the winnings from escrow. Winners can visit the site to collect their winnings.
          </li>
          <li>
            If I was not honest, I can correct the score and resubmit for approval.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <Header as="h2">How is this better than a centralized version?</Header>
        <p>
          Your money is held in escrow by a contract on the Ethereum network. I collect no fees because I run no
          infrastructure. The private key used to report the score is held by multiple people, so the score will be
          reported.
        </p>

        <Header as="h2">How can I trust you?</Header>
        <p>
          You don't have to. You are free to review the verified source code of the underlying contracts.
          I never have control over your funds, thanks to the Ethereum network.
          I built the system such that I cannot cheat it and have no incentives to lie about the score.
          In fact, I am incentivized to be honest since the optional donation is produced
          when collecting your winnings.
        </p>

        <Header as="h2">Do I have to use this site to play?</Header>
        <p>
          You are not required to interact with the contracts via this website. You may copy the ABI of the contracts
          into a wallet (e.g. <a href="https://www.myetherwallet.com/#contracts">MyEtherWallet</a>) and send
          transactions directly to the contract. It is simply more convenient to use this site.
        </p>

        <Header as="h2">How are winnings calculated?</Header>
        <p>
          Each quarter, one fourth of the total pot is distributed to the winning square. Your winnings are your
          percentage stake of that square. For example, if the pot contains 4 ETH, each quarter will pay out 1 ETH.
          If you bet 0.1 ETH on the winning square, and everyone else bet 0.3 ETH, your share is 25% of the winnings,
          or 0.25 ETH.
        </p>

        <Header as="h2">Can a square win more than once?</Header>
        <p>
          Yes. For each time a square wins, it pays out an 25% of the pot.
        </p>

        <Header as="h2">What is the &quot;donation percentage?&quot;</Header>
        <p>
          When you collect your winnings, you may optionally specify a percentage of the winnings to donate to
          compensate me for my development hours.
        </p>

        <Header as="h2">How can I vote to accept/reject the reported score?</Header>
        <p>
          The votes will be collected starting one day after the big game. The UI for this process will be released
          before the voting begins.
        </p>

        <Header as="h2">How can I collect my winnings?</Header>
        <p>
          Once the score is finalized, you can call a function on the contract to collect your winnings.
          The UI for that interaction will be built before the score is finalized.
        </p>

        <Header as="h2">Can I run this site locally?</Header>
        <p>
          Yes, you may download the html, js, and css files. All external resource links, excluding google analytics and
          Disqus, are included with subresource integrity hashes.
